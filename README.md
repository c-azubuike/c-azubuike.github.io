# Hello, and welcome to my website!
My name is Chuks, and here I introduce the dataset that piqued my interest, and a book that explores the impact of Big Data in our modern society.
Thanks for visiting!
## Dataset
I chose the dataset [_Bias in Advertising Data_](https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/bias-in-advertising/) by IBM Developer, because it offers insight into consumer behavior towards ads, influenced by factors such as education, gender, political affiliation e.tc.
I believe that although this dataset was artificially generated, it is still valuable and has considerable potential, especially within marketing and retail industries, as it can serve as a model for predicting and understanding real-world consumer responses to ads.
With this dataset, for example, one can tailor their interest to include specific demographics and use the responses from this dataset as a baseline to predict how similar demographics might react in real-world scenarios.
## Book on Big Data
My book of choice is called: [_Disruptive Possibilities: How Big Data Changes Everything_]( https://www.amazon.com/Disruptive-Possibilities-Data-Changes-Everything-ebook/dp/B00CLH387W) and was written by Jefferey Needham,who according to [O*Reilley.com]( https://www.oreilly.com/people/jeffrey-needham/),is both a writer and an engineer, as well as the founder of a consulting firm in Silicon Valley, California called “ Scale Abilities Inc.”
As mentioned earlier, I find this book interesting because I believe it discusses the impact of Big Data across industries and highlights both areas of concern and opportunities.
